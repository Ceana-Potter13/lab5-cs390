##### Q: "What do you think the onclick does?"
I think the button upon being clicked will lead to another part of the website judging by the href link.
##### Q: Why is it important for each radio button to have a unique ID?
If each button does not have a unique ID, then you cannot assign a label
specifically to that radio button.
##### Q: How can we ensure that only one character can be selected at a time?
To ensure only one character can be selected at a time, you can assign a
name="" (with a name inside the quotes) that is the same for every button. If
all radio buttons have the same name as each other, only one button can be
selected.
##### Q: What could happen if the labels aren't correctly associated with the radio buttons?
If labels are not correctly associated with the radio buttons, then there
could be one character's label assigned to all buttons rather than a unique
description for each character.
